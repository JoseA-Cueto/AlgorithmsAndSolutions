# Programming Logic Exercises

This repository contains basic and intermediate level programming exercises to practice logic, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure

- `src/InvertString.cs`: Code to reverse a string.
- `src/CountCharacterOccurrences.cs`: Code to count the occurrences of a specific character in a string.
- `src/HammingDistance.cs`: Code to calculate the Hamming distance between two strings.
- `src/WordCounter.cs`: Code to count the number of words in a string.
- `src/CountNumbers.cs`: Code to count the numbers in a
- `src/PrimeNumbers.cs`: Code to perform operations related to prime numbers.
- `src/BubbleSort.cs`:Code to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm, which sorts an array of integers in ascending order by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed.
